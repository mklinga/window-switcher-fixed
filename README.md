# Window switcher (fixed)

This is the applet "windows-quick-list@cinnamon.org" but now with keyboard shortcuts to open up the menu (with ``<Super> + ` ``) and select an item with `<Return>`.

No configurable options unfortunately because that was all that I needed... it should be simple enough to spot in the code if you really want to change this.
